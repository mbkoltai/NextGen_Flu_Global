## Modelling the effect of next generation flu vaccines globally
We selected one country per influenza transmission zone (using 7 ITZs from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2023.02.002). 
We selected the countries that have the largest numbers of years with data in the FluNet database for the period 2008-2020.
